    "1. In order to run these notebooks in your computer, perform the following steps.\n",
    "    * Download this repository by cloning it (see [Git Basics](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository)  for this).\n",
    "    * Download and install the anaconda python distribution (anaconda @ https://www.anaconda.com/). Also, see [this blog entry](https://fangohr.github.io/blog/installation-of-python-spyder-numpy-sympy-scipy-pytest-matplotlib-via-anaconda.html) on how to install anaconda.\n",
    "    * Start Anaconda, then [load Jupyter](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/user-guide/getting-started/#run-python-in-a-jupyter-notebook) and open the file 'index.ipynb' \n",
    "    * On Unix/Linux machines, install JupyterLab in anaconda and run it with the commands\n",
    "    \n",
    "            $conda install jupyterlab\n",
    "            \n",

    "The goal of this simulation is to run a statistical model simulating the evolution of Bose-Einstein Condensation (BEC) of a gas of noninteracting bosons in $3-$dimensions. Since the emergence of BECttributed to the contribution of a great many particles in an even greater number of single particle states, a statistical method is to be utilised.\n",

    "## Bose-Einstein Condensation\n",
    "A Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) is typically formed when a gas of bosons (quantum particles with integer spin) is cooled to sufficiently low temperatures where a large fraction of bosons occupy the lowest quantum state. The theoretical possibility of a BEC was raised in 1924 by Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein [1]. The phenomenon arises due to the indistinguishability of identical quantum particles, in contrast to classical particles where even identical ones are distinguishable. To see this, consider a toy problem where an ideal gas has $N$ particles populated in $2$ states, namely, state $|0\\rangle$ with energy $0$, and state $|1\\rangle$ with energy $\\epsilon$. If these particles were classical, then there would be a total of $2^N$ distinct configurations. If, however, the particles are indistinguishable, then there are only $N+1$ distinct configurations, each indexed by $K$, the number of particles in state $|1\\rangle$ (the remaining $N-K$ particles are in $|0\\rangle$). When the system is in equilibrium with an energy bath at temperature $T$, the probability of a particular configuration $K$ can be obtained from the probability distribution of the canonical ensemble [2],\n",
    "$$\n",
    "P_K = \\frac{1}{Z_N}e^{-K\\beta\\epsilon}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The partition function $Z_N$ can be obtained from the normalization condition $\\sum_K P_K=1$, yielding\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z_N = \\sum^N_{K=0} e^{-K\\beta\\epsilon} = \\frac{1-e^{-N\\beta\\epsilon}}{1-e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "In the thermodynamic limit, $\\lim_{N\\rightarrow\\infty}Z_N = (1-p_\\beta)^{-1}$, where $p_\\beta = e^{-\\beta\\epsilon}$. The average number of particles in state $|1\\rangle$, $n_1 = \\sum_K K p^K_\\beta = p_\\beta\\mathbin{/}(1-p_\\beta)$. In the limit of low temperatures, where $\\beta=(k_BT)^{-1}\\rightarrow \\infty$, $n_1$ vanishes. Since the average number of particles in the ground state $n_0 = N - n_1$, the ground state will be macroscopically populated at low temperatures. This is the onset of Bose-Einstein condensation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The phenomenon can be readily generalized to a gas of particles, distributed across many single particle states. If the number of particles is less than the number of thermally accessible states, the particles are expected to be distributed across different states at high temperature. If the gas is cooled, the number of thermally accessible states per particle becomes smaller, forcing multiple particles to occupy low-energy states. Eventually, a sufficiently cold gas of bosons will be compelled to force most of the particles into the ground state, facilitating Bose-Einstein condensation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first pure BEC was created by Eric Cornell and Carl Wieman at UC Boulder in 1995, shortly followed by Wolfgang Ketterle at MIT. The three physicists shared a nobel prize for this remarkable achievement in 2001 [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "An exact simulation of the full dynamics to its thermal equilibrium state,even of an ideal bose gas,  is computationally prohibitive, since this requires computing the quantum dynamics of $N$ particles in $M$ states through a total of $P$ many body states, where\n",

    "P = \\frac{(N+M-1)!}{N!(M-1)!}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "For even reasonable values of $N, M$, this number is too large for even super-computers to handle beyond $N, M\\sim 15$. Therefore, we will have to start from a random configuration of $N$ particles in $M$ states and simulate the transition to equilibrium stochastically. This is done via **Monte Carlo methods**.\n",
    "The subject of of this project will be statistical in nature, and hence a basic understanding of Monte Carlo methods and random number algorithms will be necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monte Carlo Methods and Bose Einstein Condensation\n",
    "Numerical computations which utilise random numbers are called Monte Carlo methods after a famous gambling hotspot in Monaco that used as a code word to denote the method, (at the time, the method was a military secret) [4]. The obvious applications of such methods are in stochastic physics: e.g., statistical thermodynamics. However, there are other, less obvious, applications including the evaluation of multi-dimensional integrals. The modern version of the Monte Carlo method was invented in the late 1940s by Stanislaw Ulam, and heavily influenced by Enrico Fermi, John von Neumann and Nicholas Metropolis [4].\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of a general discussion of Monte Carlo methods, we shall restrict our attention to a specific kind of monte carlo method calle the **Metropolis Algorithm**[4,5]. The Metropolis algorithm is a simple and widely used approach to generate the canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics. The algorithm, adapted for quantum systems, has the following steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start with some random configuration of states.\n",
    "2. Randomly choose a particle and change its state to another one that is close to it in energy.\n",
    "3. Compute the energy change $\\Delta E$ change. Accept the trial with probability $p \\sim \\exp{\\left(-\\beta\\Delta E/2\\right)}$. Note that this is different from the [classical case for the Ising model](Metrop_ising.ipynb).\n",
    "5. If trial is rejected, put the particle back.\n",
    "6. The above steps constitute one 'epoch' in the Monte Carlo method, analogous to a single unit of time passed. Calculate thermodynamic quantities summed over all the degrees of freedom.\n",
    "7. Keep repeating these epochs until the thermodynamic quantities appear to stabilize in an orbit. That will be the thermal equilibrium point.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see why this algorithm will cause the system to attain thermal equilibrium in a canonical ensemble, consider that this simulation follows a Markov Chain, which is completely specified by a transition probability matrix $\\pi_{AB}$ — the probability of jumping to state B with a single particle transition, if the current state is A. During the runtime of the algorithm, we do not provide special preference to decreasing energy (unlike the [classical case for the Ising model](Metrop_ising.ipynb)), as the many body states are stationary eigenstates where the system, if kept in isolation and populated in one, remains stable. However, each *change* in the state  is only accepted with probability $\\exp{(-\\beta\\Delta E\\mathbin{/}2)}$, since this process is supposed to simulate the stochastic exchange of thermal  energy from a bath at constant temperature $T=1/k_B\\beta$. Consider any two many body states $|A\\rangle$ and $|B\\rangle$. If the acceptance probabilities  for a transition from state $|A\\rangle$ to state $|B\\rangle$ is $p^{acc}_{AB}$, then $\\pi_{AB} \\sim p^{acc}_{AB}$, and $\\pi_{BA}\\sim p^{acc}_{BA} $. Now, when the system is in equilibrium, we expect the principle of **detailed balance** to hold, where the probability from going from state $|A\\rangle$ to $|B\\rangle$ is the same as the probability of the reverse process *i.e.* going from $|B\\rangle$ to $|A\\rangle$ [5]. This way, all $A\\rightarrow B$ transitions in an equilibrium orbit of the Metropolis dynamics cancel out with $B\\rightarrow A$ transitions. Thus, at equilibrium,\n",
    "$$\n",
    "p_{A\\rightarrow B} = p_A \\pi_{AB} = p_{B\\rightarrow A} = p_B\\pi_{BA},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $p_{A,B}$ are the equilibrium probabilities of states $A$ and $B$ independently. Thus, \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{p_A}{p_B} = \\frac{\\pi_{BA}}{\\pi_{AB}} = \\frac{p^{acc}_{BA}}{p^{acc}_{AB}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Finally, if our numerical algorithm chooses $p^{acc}_{AB} \\sim e^{\\beta\\left(E_A - E_B\\right)/2}$ and $p^{acc}_{BA}  \\sim e^{-\\beta\\left(E_A - E_B\\right)/2}$, then \n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{p_A}{p_B} = \\frac{p^{acc}_{BA}}{p^{acc}_{AB}} = e^{-\\beta\\left(E_A - E_B\\right)} = \\frac{e^{-\\beta E_A}}{e^{-\\beta E_B}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "for all pairs of states $A$ and $B$. Therefore, $p_r\\sim \\exp{\\left(-\\beta E_r\\right)}$ for any state $r$, which is the canonical ensemble.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only issue that remains to be addressed is how to take into account the indistinguishability of identical particles. In order to do so, we choose to implement the system under consideration in a quantum lattice gas. A classical lattice gas incorporates the use of point masses on a regular lattice for simulations in which space, time, and velocity are discretized. In a quantum lattice gas, there is a tower of states, organized regularly (like a lattice). Each state can accommodate multiple particles. In a classical lattice gas, identical (point) particles occupying these states are considered to be distinguishable and any unique configuration of particles in states is counted once. In quantum mechanics, this would be incorrect, since permuting particles from dictinct states would lead to a different state only in classical statistics, not quantum. In order to mimic quantum indistinguishability in a lattice gas, we arrange the particles on an array, labelling them $1-N$. Each particle has associated with it the quantum numbers of a single particle state. As long as we ensure that the order of particles remains unchanged when changing the states by the Monte Carlo method, we ensure that permutations of states are discounted, thus ensuring that classical counting is not taking place [6].\n",

    "## Numerical Implementation\n",
    "The code cell below executes the Metropolis algorithm of a $3-$ dimensional ideal bose gas in an isotropic harmonic trap. If the trap has a confining frequency of $\\Omega$, then the energy levels are given by three integer quantum numbers $(n,l,m)$, where \n",

The other quantum numbers span degenerate eigenstates, with the orbital component of the angular momentum $l\\in [0,n-1]\\;\\forall n$ and the $z-$ component of the angular momentum $m\\in[-l,l]\\;\\forall l$. Thus, choosing $M$ to be the highest value of $n$ yields a tower of states of size $S$, where\n",

Each row of this matrix is associated with a particle, and the three column values are the three $n,l,m$ values that denote the state of that particle. Next, we create an array $A$ of size $N$ and populate it with random integers from the range $[0,M]$ after sorting by energy. After sorting the array in increasing order, we populate the first column of $B$ with $A$, then populate the remaining matrix elements with allowed $l$ and $m$ values, chosen randomly.
